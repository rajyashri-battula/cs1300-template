      <h1 class="w3-text-teal">Problem Summary</h1>
      <p>I live in an apartment with three other female identifying friends, where we have a shared hair blow-dryer in the bathroom cabinet. Since my roommates use this appliance in different ways and in different frequencies, I interviewed each of them to understand how they interact with the blow-dryer. I asked them a series of questions to understand their motives, pain points, preferences and expectations from the external design of the device.

      Here’s my (not so pretty) drawing of the physical interface of the blow-dryer. The blow dryer has a basic function: dry the user’s hair when they have just washed it. It does this by blowing out hot air in order to bring all the moisture out of the hair strands and the scalp. The blow-dryer that my roommates and I use has functionalities for high and low speed (of the air blown out) and the heat generated can be set to low, medium or high. There is also a separate functionality to just blast cold air. There are two steps to using this dryer: 1) Plugging it in 2) Pressing the preferred button on it.

Part 1: In the bottom right corner of the drawing, you can see the plug. The back of it has two visible buttons in red and yellow: one that’s labelled “reset” and the other labelled “test.” Once plugged in, the hair dryer does not work until the test button is first pressed and then the reset button. I found that this is the right order of pressing these buttons on Googling this type of an outlet, but none of my interviewees understood what these buttons did and they simply bruteforce pressed both randomly until the dryer started working.

Part 2: There are only 3 buttons on the dryer: one stand-alone pressable button labelled “Cool Blast”, and two scrollable buttons named “Heat” and “Speed.” Heat button has three modes: high, medium and low, while Speed button has three modes: high, low, off. My diagram below shows the difference in usage of these modes. High heat, high speed was used most often among my interviewees. Low heat, high speed was second most used. Low speed was occasionally used while medium heat was barely ever used. 2 of my interviewees had no idea what the cool blast button did and never thought to use them. The other accidentally pressed it once and figured that it lets out cold air and now she sometimes uses this functionality. The other 2 simply went to the “low heat” setting in order to get cold air.

      <h1 class="w3-text-teal">Interview Summary</h1>
      <p>My questions ranged from asking each of them about their getting-ready routine, to their favorite hair styling products, to more specific questions about their usage of the blow dryer. I ended by asking them to use the product for me, while I asked them questions about the ease of usage, the hand-holding affordance of its physical shape, and the conveyability of its buttons. A summary of the questions and their answers is given below.

      Holding it: my interviewees immediately held the appliance the way it’s meant to be held, at the intersection of the horizontal and the vertical parts with the full palm of the dominant hand (fingers wrapped around the vertical piece) and pointed the air nozzle to their hair.

Switching it on: they plugged it in, moved the heat button from “off” to “high”. The dryer didn’t turn on. So they pressed the red (red first) and yellow buttons until it turned on.

Using it: the heat button was already set to “high” so they continued on that setting. After drying the hair out of all moisture, they moved to the low heat setting but remained on high speed. They were intuitively able to move the buttons around without even momentarily stopping to think about how to use them.

Problem points: they had no idea what the black “cool blast” button did. One interviewee accidentally discovered this functionality when she pressed it by mistake but none of them ever thought to use it otherwise. They wished it came with different types of nozzles to channel the hair differently. They also wished that there was an obvious place to wrap the wire around when storing it so that it doesn’t come loose. They also wished that the horizontal part collapsed/folded into the vertical part (in an inward U shape) so that it could be stored or transported easily when travelling.

Their interview recordings.

Numbered list of questions and response summaries. Highlight main points.

Overall: They seemed very comfortable with its usage. They have used different models and brands of this appliance but noted that they all had similar functionality.
